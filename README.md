# parallels-tools-linux
A fixed version of parallels tools for Parallels 14 to run Linux kernel 5.0 and above
This allows you to finally make your display resolution correct and be able to have a shared clipboard with MacOS and Linux.
Works up until Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine. (May work beyond this too. But I have not tested)

To install:
1. Clone this repo
2. Give installer/install-cli.sh executable permissions (chmod 777 *.sh)
3. Run the command $ installer/install-cli.sh -i --verbose
